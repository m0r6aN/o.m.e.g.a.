# OMEGA Workflow Builder Real-Time Integration

This document outlines the enhanced workflow builder with real-time execution visualization we've built for the OMEGA Framework.

## Overview

We've enhanced the existing workflow builder with real-time status updates via WebSockets, improved node styling, and better status visualization. This allows users to see their workflow execution progress in real-time, with nodes changing color and displaying status as they are processed.

## Components Created/Enhanced

### 1. Enhanced Node Components
- **BaseNode**: A more visually appealing base node component with status indicators, animations, and better styling
- **Specialized Node Types**: Agent, Tool, Trigger, and Output nodes with appropriate icons and colors
- **Status Visualization**: Color-coding, icons, and animations based on execution status

### 2. WebSocket Integration
- **WebSocket Client**: Real-time connection to track workflow execution status
- **use-workflow-execution Hook**: Custom hook to manage WebSocket connections and update node statuses
- **WebSocket Server**: Backend implementation to broadcast execution updates

### 3. Execution Utilities
- **Execution Status Updates**: Functions to update node and workflow execution status
- **Redis Integration**: Pub/sub system to distribute status updates to connected clients
- **Execution Simulation**: Demo implementation for testing without a real backend

### 4. Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Added WebSocket URL configuration
- **API Routes**: Support for workflow execution with real-time updates

## How It Works

1. **Workflow Execution**
   - User clicks "Execute" on a workflow
   - Frontend makes a POST request to `/api/workflows/{id}/execute`
   - Backend starts execution and returns an execution ID
   - Frontend establishes a WebSocket connection to `/ws/workflows/executions/{id}`

2. **Real-Time Updates**
   - As each node runs, backend publishes updates to Redis
   - WebSocket server receives updates from Redis and broadcasts to connected clients
   - Frontend receives updates via WebSocket and updates node status:
     - Pending → Running → Completed/Failed
     - Nodes change color and icon based on status
     - Status messages displayed in nodes

3. **Visualization Features**
   - Running nodes show animated spinner icon
   - Completed nodes show green checkmark
   - Failed nodes show red X icon
   - Edges can animate to show data flow (optional enhancement)
   - Status badge shows current state with appropriate icon

## Usage Example

```tsx
// In workflow-builder.tsx
const {
  isConnected: wsConnected,
  lastMessage: wsLastMessage,
  error: wsError
} = useWorkflowExecution(executionId, nodes, setNodes);

// WebSocket updates node status automatically
// Example update message:
{
  executionId: "exec-123",
  workflowId: "wf-456",
  nodeId: "node-2",
  status: "completed",
  timestamp: "2025-05-03T15:30:45Z",
  message: "Research completed successfully",
  data: { result: "Found 15 relevant documents" }
}
```

## Additional Features

1. **Execution Simulation (Dev Mode)**
   - For testing without a backend
   - Simulates execution progress with realistic timing
   - Random success/failure to test error handling

2. **Connection Status Indicators**
   - Shows WebSocket connection status
   - Animated indicator for active connections
   - Clear error messages if connection fails

3. **Execution Summary**
   - Panel appears when execution completes
   - Shows overall status and links to detailed results

## Next Steps

1. **Edge Animation**
   - Animate edges to show data flowing through connections

2. **Data Preview**
   - Show sample data passing between nodes
   - Expandable data viewers for complex objects

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Ensure smooth updates even with many nodes
   - Handle large execution data efficiently

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - More detailed error information
   - Automatic recovery options

These enhancements bring us much closer to the n8n-style visual experience while keeping implementation practical and focused on high-impact features.
