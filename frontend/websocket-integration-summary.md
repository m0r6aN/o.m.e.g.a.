# WebSocket Integration Improvements

## Overview

We've refactored the WebSocket implementation to properly integrate with the existing Docker-based WebSocket server infrastructure. This ensures our workflow visualization can receive real-time updates during execution without trying to create a duplicate WebSocket server.

## Key Improvements

1. **Client-Side Integration**
   - Updated the WebSocket client to connect to the existing WebSocket server
   - Added reconnection logic with configurable parameters
   - Improved error handling and connection status indicators

2. **Configuration**
   - Added WebSocket-specific configuration in the environment settings
   - Centralized WebSocket URL and port configuration
   - Introduced feature flags to enable/disable WebSocket-based visualization

3. **Execution Utilities**
   - Refactored to work with external WebSocket server
   - Added simulation capabilities for development/testing
   - Improved API integration with RESTful endpoints

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Added connection status indicators
   - Improved completion notification panel
   - Added simulation mode for development testing

## WebSocket Client Features

The improved WebSocket client now includes:

- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatically attempts to reconnect if the connection is lost
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback on connection status (connected, connecting, error)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection failures
- **Configurable Parameters**: Settings for reconnection attempts and delays

## Environment Configuration

We've updated the environment configuration with specific WebSocket settings:

```
# WebSocket settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL="ws://localhost:9500/ws"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_PORT="9500"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_RECONNECT_DELAY="2000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS="5"
```

## Development Mode Simulation

For testing and development without requiring the full backend infrastructure, we've added a simulation mode that:

1. Mimics real-time status updates
2. Processes nodes in sequence with realistic timing
3. Randomly simulates success/failure scenarios
4. Updates node styling and status indicators just like real execution

## Integration with Workflow Builder

The workflow builder now includes:

1. **Status Alert Banner**: Shows current WebSocket connection status
2. **Completion Panel**: Appears when execution completes or fails
3. **Simulation Button**: In development mode, allows testing without backend
4. **Feature Flags**: Can disable WebSocket-based visualization for compatibility

## Usage

The updated workflow-builder.tsx now integrates with the WebSocket client as follows:

```typescript
// Add the WebSocket hook
const {
  isConnected: wsConnected,
  lastMessage: wsLastMessage,
  error: wsError,
} = useWorkflowExecution(executionId, nodes, setNodes);

// Status updates happen automatically via WebSocket
// The nodes' status and appearance update in real-time
```

## Next Steps

1. **Data Visualization**: Show actual data values passing between nodes
2. **Path Animation**: Animate data flow along the connections between nodes
3. **Error Recovery**: Allow users to retry failed nodes or steps
4. **Execution History**: View previous executions and compare results
