# Templates for common workflows 

### A bit like Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) but for agent orchestration - "workflows-as-code" (WaC) if you will.

#### The Gist of It

**Template Repository**: Create a structured storage for workflow templates that the orchestrator can access. Each template would define:

- Required agents and their roles
- Execution sequence
- Expected inputs/outputs
- Decision points and branching logic

**Progressive Learning**: When the workflow composer builds a workflow that doesn't have a template, it automatically creates one, storing both the abstract pattern and the concrete implementation.

**Continuous Improvement**: As workflows execute, the system collects performance metrics and success rates. The workflow composer could periodically review and refine templates based on:

- Execution time
- Success rate
- Resource usage
- User feedback

**Parameterization**: Templates should have clear "injection points" where specific project details get inserted, making them adaptable to similar but distinct requirements.

**The Workflow Composer**: 

- Match user requests to templates
- Fill in parameters based on user requirements
- Execute the workflow, coordinating agent interactions
- Monitor execution and collect metrics
- Periodically refine templates based on execution data

This approach would make the entire system much more efficient and reliable over time. Each successful workflow execution becomes a learning opportunity to improve future executions. We'll need to work out model fine-tuning and metrics collection.
